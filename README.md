# INTERGALACTIC-NAMERATOR

This repository contains the code for the Intergalactic Namerator, a neural network model designed to generate names for intergalactic entities. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of names based on the Rick and Morty characters and utilizes advanced tokenization techniques to produce unique and creative outputs.

## Purpose

This project aims to explore the capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in generating novel names that fit within the thematic context of intergalactic settings. It serves as both a fun application of machine learning and a demonstration of text generation techniques.

## Features

- RNN-based name generation
- Custom tokenizer for handling unique character sets
- Easy-to-use API for generating names
- Logging and monitoring capabilities
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Contributing
